HeidiSQL, previously known as MySQL-Front, is a FREE and open source client developed by German programmer Ansgar Becker and a few other contributors in Delphi. To manage databases with HeidiSQL, users must login to a local or remote MySQL server with acceptable credentials, creating a session. Within this session users may manage MySQL Databases within the connected MySQL server, disconnecting from the server when done. Its feature set is sufficient for most common and advanced database, table and data record operations but remains in active development to move towards the full functionality expected in a MySQL Frontend.

A version written in Java, jHeidi, which is designed to work on Mac and Linux computers, also exists. Unfortunately, the project has been discontinued since March 2010.

Our final entry is another studio containing a complete collection of tools for MySQL Server administration.   Developers will appreciate its ability to create/edit/drop database objects, DB synchronization, and data export/import. DBAs can also use MyDB Studio to perform database migration, as well as backups and restores.  It supports SSH tunneling to secure your connections, which allows you to connect even if your host doesn't allow you remote access connection, user and privilege management, and PHP script creation.

I am confident that you will find a product to suit your needs in this group.  They are in no particular order, so feel free to try any that catches your eye.  I should also point out that I received absolutely no financial compensation from any of these companies.  My assessment of each product is based on my unbiased opinion.  As such, my top ten list may diverge slightly from the general consensus.
